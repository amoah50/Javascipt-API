# Javascipt API
 # Dog Image Gallery

## Objective
The goal of this project is to fetch data from a public API using JavaScript and display it on a webpage in a presentable manner.

## Chosen API
**Dog CEO's Dog API**: This API provides random images of dogs. I found this API interesting because it offers a simple and fun way to display dynamic content, making the user experience enjoyable.

## Implementation
- **HTML**: Basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and responsive interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for fetching and displaying dog images from the API.

## Files
- `index.html`: HTML structure
- `styles.css`: CSS for styling
- `script.js`: JavaScript for functionality

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the "Fetch Dog Image" button to retrieve and display a random dog image.
